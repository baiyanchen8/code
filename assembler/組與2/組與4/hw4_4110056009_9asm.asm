; Program Description :
    ; Write a procedure named CountNearMatches that receives poiners to two arrays of signed doubleswords,  parameter that indicates the length of the two arrays and a parameter that indicates the maximum allowed difference between any two correspnding elements.
    ; For each element x_i in the first array, if the difference between it and the matching y_i in the second array is less thn or equal to diff increment a count.
    ; At the end, return a count of the number of nearly matching array elements in EAX. Write a test program that calls CountNearMatches and passes the pointers to two different pairs of arrays.
    ; Use the INVOKE statement to call your procedure and pass stack parameters. Create a PROTO declaration for CountNearMatches. Save and restore any registers (other than EAX) changed by your procedure.
